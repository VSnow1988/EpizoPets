Features to add:

Hunting feature - You can hunt for pets to eat. A random pet that is not yours will be chosen.
	If you kill it, you can eat it. But you can lose the fight! 
	You may also encounter a feral pet (a pet with no owner, happens when a user dies.) which you can keep.

ScoreBoard - The highest maxhp reached by a player or a specific type of pet will be shown here. Gotta have something to win
	in this meaningless existence, right?
